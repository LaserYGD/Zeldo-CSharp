Windmill notes:

=> Windmill structure melded with a gigantic tree, whose enormous roots can be traversed as part of the dungeon (both above and below ground)

===== GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS =====

- Consideration 1: the gameplay (probably mostly ignore realism and just focus on building a run level)
- Consideration 2: pacing (make sure appropriate lessons are taught early and reinforced as needed, and both the difficulty *and* creativity of skill application increases) => The hardest challenges should be *optional*
- Consideration 3: linearity (should be mostly linear, but with platforming options within individual rooms)
- Consideration 4: theme (central structure should be primarily mechanical, using gears, pulleys, and ropes to move platforms, but with more natural elements woven in)
- Consideration 5: difficulty (the windmill is relatively early in the game, maybe even the first dungeon, so it should generally be pretty easy, especially for experienced players) => Must still be *fun* for experienced players
- Consideration 6: length (target 30-60 minutes on a first playthrough)
- Consideration 7: puzzles (the windmill is light on puzzles, only requiring arranging a few gears to reach the top, plus optional sunlight-based puzzles) => The gear puzzles are really meant to serve the platforming, since they require traversing up and down a few times
- Consideration 8: rewards (the player is given the Ascend skill in this dungeon, along with an item TBD)

===== PROGRESSION =====

1. Player is given a key to the windmill (from an NPC).
2. Player reaches the dungeon and enters (brief cutscene plays). => The side structure can be reached as well, but it's locked.
3. Player climbs until reaching a room with a few enemies (must be defeated to progress). => First combat encounter in the dungeon, so it's intentionally light (and not too climactic).
4. The path further up is blocked, so the player crosses a bridge to the side structure.
5. Upward progress is still blocked, so the player climbs *down* the second structure until reaching the basement (optionally opening the locked door) and acquires Ascend.
6. Player climbs up the side structure again (faster with Ascend). At the top, defeating a miniboss causes the first set of gears to start spinning (which unblocks progression in the main structure).
7. Player crosses the bridge again to continue up the main structure.
8. TBD
