- If energy is infinite, what effect does that have on the economy?

- What if the races are attuned? (like the underground race being innately attuned to the essence of light)

- If a powerful essence of water could flood a town, that's a huge risk, but if the characters in the world didn't behave as such, that would be pretty immersion-breaking

- This stuff alleviates NPC fatigue by making you actually curious about who you're talking to

- Anything with permanence in the world is super important

- The game is non-linear (and characters should react appropriately), but make sure those reactions aren't too shallow

- In Oblivion/Skyrim, you can ask NPCs for rumors (which might spawn side quests). In Essence, characters could largely keep to themselves (within their town/zone), but YOU could provide those rumors (since you're the adventurer), and have that information propagate and even spur action by the villagers => Should probably use a hybrid system here

- If you go back and talk to an NPC who told you something, the dialogue should update to reflect what you've done/seen/learned since then

- Should the player character in Essence be a silent protagonist?

- I want the changes in the world to be based on choices the player makes through GAMEPLAY, not dialogue choices => Could still have NPCs react to the player implicitly (reacting to something you said, even though you never said it)

- What's the targeted overall length for a playthrough? How much (in terms of percentage) is a "normal" playthrough vs. 100% completion and late-game secrets? => I want a hidden late-game dungeon

- For the first game, what if we focused on only ONE essence? Would probably help massively in reducing the scope of the game, but would also set up a great foundation for future games or DLC => Would have to reduce the scope of the world as a result (and the number of races you meet)

- If you see one or two other races (even if they don't play a major role in the game), it would (hopefully) pique player curiosity about those races (which puts you in a great spot for future content)

- Could focus on one particular race's discovery of magic (but not necessarily the first race to EVER discover magic)

- Skippy said that a strength of his is "troubleshooting", like big-picture concerns (such as the nature of the world's economy if infinite-energy objects exist, and how valuable those would be) => Obi probably is too (but also excels at the details of that stuff)

- Could consider "tiers" of NPCs (main characters, secondary characters, and unnamed NPCs that largely don't speak or just provide flavor text) => Could help reduce NPC fatigue by reducing the number of characters to revisit

- What does the map screen look like? => I want to encourage the player to explore and focus on the world (rather than a screen)

- Can the player rotate the camera? If so, should the camera snap to four directions  Skippy mentioned he can't think of a single game with this style that can do that => With 3D, you kinda get this for free (and it'd be easy to experiment)

- With snapping, players might forget they can rotate the camera, which could cause frustrating if secrets are hidden behind an object (especially since camera rotation isn't common in the genre)

- Should the game just be a full 3D adventure?

- Secret "X marks the spot", an X formed by the environment that's visible from an elevated location (could lead to treasure or an optional upgrade)

- City with a river passing through it (few bridges across) => If the river is large, could be like sister cities across the river, with some level of rivalry between them

- Enemies who throw things at you (ranged attack), but they can be reflected back (maybe aimed, maybe automatically hit back?)

- In some dungeon, you can hear a curious, slightly unsettling noise for a while (to various degrees as you explore the dungeon), with the source (likely a boss) only revealed late (inspired by watching early footage of The Surge 2) => Might be too dark and creepy for what I'm going for with the game?
