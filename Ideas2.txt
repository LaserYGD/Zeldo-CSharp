- If energy is infinite, what effect does that have on the economy?

- What if the races are attuned? (like the underground race being innately attuned to the essence of light)

- If a powerful essence of water could flood a town, that's a huge risk, but if the characters in the world didn't behave as such, that would be pretty immersion-breaking

- This stuff alleviates NPC fatigue by making you actually curious about who you're talking to

- Anything with permanence in the world is super important

- The game is non-linear (and characters should react appropriately), but make sure those reactions aren't too shallow

- In Oblivion/Skyrim, you can ask NPCs for rumors (which might spawn side quests). In Essence, characters could largely keep to themselves (within their town/zone), but YOU could provide those rumors (since you're the adventurer), and have that information propagate and even spur action by the villagers => Should probably use a hybrid system here

- If you go back and talk to an NPC who told you something, the dialogue should update to reflect what you've done/seen/learned since then

- Should the player character in Essence be a silent protagonist?

- I want the changes in the world to be based on choices the player makes through GAMEPLAY, not dialogue choices => Could still have NPCs react to the player implicitly (reacting to something you said, even though you never said it)

- What's the targeted overall length for a playthrough? How much (in terms of percentage) is a "normal" playthrough vs. 100% completion and late-game secrets? => I want a hidden late-game dungeon

- For the first game, what if we focused on only ONE essence? Would probably help massively in reducing the scope of the game, but would also set up a great foundation for future games or DLC => Would have to reduce the scope of the world as a result (and the number of races you meet)

- If you see one or two other races (even if they don't play a major role in the game), it would (hopefully) pique player curiosity about those races (which puts you in a great spot for future content)

- Could focus on one particular race's discovery of magic (but not necessarily the first race to EVER discover magic)

- Skippy said that a strength of his is "troubleshooting", like big-picture concerns (such as the nature of the world's economy if infinite-energy objects exist, and how valuable those would be) => Obi probably is too (but also excels at the details of that stuff)

- Could consider "tiers" of NPCs (main characters, secondary characters, and unnamed NPCs that largely don't speak or just provide flavor text) => Could help reduce NPC fatigue by reducing the number of characters to revisit

- What does the map screen look like? => I want to encourage the player to explore and focus on the world (rather than a screen)

- Can the player rotate the camera? If so, should the camera snap to four directions  Skippy mentioned he can't think of a single game with this style that can do that => With 3D, you kinda get this for free (and it'd be easy to experiment)

- With snapping, players might forget they can rotate the camera, which could cause frustrating if secrets are hidden behind an object (especially since camera rotation isn't common in the genre)

- Should the game just be a full 3D adventure?

- Secret "X marks the spot", an X formed by the environment that's visible from an elevated location (could lead to treasure or an optional upgrade)

- City with a river passing through it (few bridges across) => If the river is large, could be like sister cities across the river, with some level of rivalry between them

- Enemies who throw things at you (ranged attack), but they can be reflected back (maybe aimed, maybe automatically hit back?)

- In some dungeon, you can hear a curious, slightly unsettling noise for a while (to various degrees as you explore the dungeon), with the source (likely a boss) only revealed late (inspired by watching early footage of The Surge 2) => Might be too dark and creepy for what I'm going for with the game?

- Super, incredibly, unreasonably long ladder with epic music playing to emphasize how silly it is (maybe with a wisp-like companion character who comments while you're climbing) => Could play into the Ascend skill to really showcase how much more fluidly and quickly the character can move around

- Area/city built for large creatures (some kind of giants) as a way to experiment with the player's movement options in large spaces (inspired by watching Joseph Anderson's video on Dark Souls and seeing the character run through these huge, flat areas with nothing to block you)

- Make sure to include little things to reward the player's observation (inspired by a Dark Souls clip of shooting down a body hanging by a rope using a bow for a hidden item)

- Consider pacing in the overall design of the game (inspired by Mark Brown's Boss Keys episode on Dark Souls, where he splits the game into five acts and mentions that 1, 3, and 5 are relatively short and linear, while 2 and 4 are longer and more complex and branching)

- For fast travel, try to brainstorm ways to not ruin the player's sense of exploration and presence in the world (since, with something like a teleport, you don't need to think critically and understand how the world fits together)

- Think about ways to give the player options in exploring the world while still maintaining an interesting challenge (likely by making each zone *different* rather than simply scaling difficulty, i.e. try to test different player skills)

- If you showcase a cool area, make sure the player is able to actually go there (or at least interact in some interesting way) => Inspired by Joseph Anderson's video on The Ringed City where he said he was disappointed he couldn't explore this huge city the game drew attention to

- Sliding challenge section (inspired by watching a slide in that 3D Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban game) => Probably not an actual slide, but maybe a hilly section that accommodates multiple slides well

- Late-game puzzle inspired by that idea I had for the GMTK jam 2019: each version of the game has slightly different aspects in some key ways, and players need to work together as a community to solve the final puzzle (maybe contextualized as alternate realities?) => Probably not worth it, but who knows

- Elevator system from the cave village to a surface city (maybe the capitol?) that's only built following certain world events that improve relations among the two cities (or maybe you discover them underground and then help to start forming a new relationship to stay more positive?) => Could take a bit of in-game time, advancing when you exit and reload? Might be too slow for speedrunning considerations

- Spiral plant, like little springs (inspired by a picture on Reddit of a spiral pepper)

- Smooth transitions as the game starts up => Load a scene from the most recent save file, and start playing soft music and ambient noises during the splash screen and into the title, then, when the player selects Continue, briefly pan the camera down to the player's location (if another file is chosen, you can do a proper load with a quick screen transition through black)

- Hydra-like boss that you slowly defeat over the course of probably three encounters (chipping away at it each time) => Lots of games do this already though, in the sense of a repeated boss fight (e.g. Klungo from Banjo Tooie)

- Make sure enemies are varied (in terms of playstyle, but also visually so you don't just have a bunch of humanoids)

- Minor tech to quickly increase downward movement (inspired by Dead Cell's quick downward stomp mechanic, but also Ori's stomp. Could get boring to just walk off a ledge and wait to fall without any means to better control your movement) => If it's a stomp, the transition from hitting the ground to regular movement needs to be smooth (maybe a button press just after the stomp that gives a quick boost in some direction?) => Feels un-smooth to have a stomp kill your horizontal momentum most of the time

- Make sure the player can level up outside of the game as well as powering up in game (inspired by Joseph Anderson's video on Dragon's Dogma) => In other words, skills need depth and precision (including how they're chained together) so that, with practice, players can get better and faster and more efficient with damage

- How are mistakes punished in various areas? (primarly platforming mistakes and combat mistakes, but also maybe inventory mistakes, like selling an important piece of gear) => Needs to be balanced properly to make the game challenging, but not ultra hard

- Make sure that players, in addition to locations they're guided to by the main quest, can explore and discover cool places for themselves (and actually progress without too many locked doors punishing their curiosity) => Also inspired by Dragon's Dogma (where Joseph Anderson said he found cool places, but the front door was always locked until he reached the appropriate quest)

- For AOE attacks (like boss explosions after a charge time), should display a dim circle (or sphere) that subtly shows its range

- Parry mechanic (in some form, and ideally different skills can parry/reflect different kinds of attacks in different ways, such as knocking a thrusting, fast enemy off center, making them vulnerable to attack)

- After watching Spike struggle with the Broken Vessel in Hollow Knight for a while, I hate contact damage with enemies and almost certainly won't implement it in Essence (with the exception of, for example, an enemy clearly covered in spikes or spewing toxic gas or something) => Could also experiment with reversing the system and damaging enemies when they touch you, IF you're wearing appropriate gear

- Being stunned in place temporarily following a long fall never feels good (since it interrupts the flow of movement and might expose you to damage) => Inspired by HK, but Odyssey does the same thing

- If there's a dash, dashing into a wall should allow an immediate, smooth wall jump (likely with a small amount of input buffering) => Inspired by watching Spike play the forced aerial section of the HK arena and dashing into nearby walls, but still stuck in the dash animation and unable to cleanly and quickly gain wall control

- Probably better to focus on interesting, memorable boss fights rather than strictly long or difficult ones (although the various gimmicks should still generally introduce fun, engaging new challenges as well) => Inspired by watching Eiko face an early boss in Astral Chain, and I was intrigued at what looked like free exploration and tracking down a boss before starting a fight in an open environment

- Should have the effects of defeating bosses be noticeable and worthwhile in some way

- Hidden passage from the throne room to another area (or maybe from a dungeon cell?)

- Hidden area in the ground, signalled by a hollow sound when you walk across it (inspired by the hidden White Defender boss in HK, accessed by ground pounding an unmarked section of floor) => Could arguably use subtle environmental arrangements to point to a special location

- Puzzles involving water manipulation (like using an essence to create an aerial arc of water to swim over a gap) => Could experiment with currents as well

- Octopus boss as the first (or very early) part of the dungeon, as the "keeper" of the water essence (he uses it against you in various ways, which has a side effect of teaching you some of the essence's uses) => That idea of every essence having a "Keeper" seems like a great idea

- Could experiment with wind directions in the windmill dungeon as a puzzle mechanism (like aligning gears or directions) => Skippy's idea, inspired by BotW's Divine Beasts, where pressing buttons or flipping switches affects the entire dungeon at a large scale

- For the windmill, the entire, giant structure could slowly rotate in response to dynamic wind (hear a creak as the structure starts to move, see shafts of sunlight change, look out the window and see yourself rotating), but still maintain the level design (since everything inside the dungeon remained relatively fixed)

- Boss with an attack that throws you into the air and knocks you away, but allows you to recover and control yourself using regular movement mechanics (inspired by watching Spike face Champion Gundyr, who has an attack that launches you into the air, followed by a quick shoulder charge) => The boss could even jump after you to add a lot more dynamic movement to the fight

- Boss using reflected sunlight via shafts in the ceiling (maybe you have to trigger the boss to break them during the fight?) => Could also add a few breakable spots throughout the dungeon to optionally make the fight easier

- Trees with distinct shapes and different-colored leaves in different zones (inspired by a cool picture on Reddit of a tree changing colors from green to bright orange, but since Essence doesn't have seasons, the colors have to be applied to different trees more permanently)

- Followup idea: using an essence (the essence of nature, maybe?) to affect plans (trees, grass, flowers, foliage, etc.) near the player (almost like a soft radial explosion that causes plants to move, change color, grow fruit, etc.) => This brings up an interesting thought, which is including elements in a trailer (like this visual flair explosion) without necessarily spoiling exactly WHAT the thing is or HOW it's used. As a rule of thumb, that could be a very effective way to build an intriguing trailer without spoiling the cool parts too much

- Consider a nameplate-style game title with 3D zoom (inspired by a part of Titanfall 2 by Bryonato during host judgements for AGDQ 2020)

- Consider having no achievements (inspired by a Twitter post by Noel Berry criticizing achievements, which I agreed with) => If achievements are required for Steam, could compromise by only adding achievements for mainline progression events, such that all players who beat the game will automatically have all achievements

- Make sure to include some puzzles simply hidden in the world to discover and solve (inspired by the Luigi's Mansion TAS, when you enter a dark room with five unlit candles around a circle and you have to siphon flame from an outside torch to light them and open a door)

- Could consider building larger zones to explore along with smaller, more controlled challenges and dungeons (inspired by Joseph Anderson's video on BotW, when he talked about slowly gliding and looking around to see what catches your attention) => For me, BotW exploration quickly fell flat when I realized that there was nothing of substance to find anywhere, even if things look intriguing (no new, permanent items, no immediate upgrades, no proper hidden dungeons, no character questlines to advance, no deep endgame secrets, no worthwhile hidden enemies and bosses, and often no reward AFTER the discovery, like the world permanently reacting)
 
- I value exploration and discovery very heavily, but remember that other people primarily play Zelda-like games for bosses or items

- NPC you can find that crafts many of the weapons used by mobs in the game (inspired by hearing Joseph Anderson talk about stealing dragonbone weapons in BotW, which prompted the thought, "Where are the dragons from which these weapons are being created?")

- With all of this, remember to think about how these ideas fit into the theme of a magical world with essences

- Bow with a rope attached (can be used for puzzle solving or movement, including ascension targets) => Would have to make sure this combination doesn't trivialize vertical platforming

- Dungeon where the game takes away an item (forcing you to think more creatively about how to proceed without it) => Inspired by a discussion in Vula's server about how Ori doesn't teach the depth of its mechanics well enough, and removing Sein temporarily could help break tunnel vision (Sigma also said that it feels potentially immersion-breaking to magically remove a skill, e.g. suddenly, you can't wall jump) => If you take away an item, though, you'd have to consider what happens if the player turns around and leaves the item lost while exploring the rest of the world

- Consider ways to optionally increase the difficulty for extra rewards or variety (inspired by Vaati's first impressions video on DS2, where he mentioned bonfire ascetics and NG+ rather than traditional difficulty modes)

- Make sure the tutorial is optional (so players aren't frustrated or bored on second playthroughs or speedruns)

- For all health bars (but especially bosses), make sure the last sliver of health can't be confused for the enemy being dead (inspired by watching Ela's Bloodborne All Bosses PB, where sometimes I wasn't sure if a boss was dead of had a sliver left) => Could be accomplished by keeping total health values low or artificially weighting the fill percentage such that 1 HP left is still easily visible

- For fast travel, could consider four kinds: 1) above ground (some kind of flying animal maybe), 2) on the ground (the train system), 3) below ground (something in the caves), and 4) teleportation-based => Inspired by the Boss Keys episode on Metroid Prime 3, which showed a clip of Samus's ship flying to new planets (reminds me of Ratchet and Clank as well)

- In that same episode of Boss Keys (on Metroid Prime 3), Mark Brown mentions a final dungeon that you have to slowly power up with power cells found on other planets (could do something similar in Essence, although the revisited dungeon should be first discoverable in the mid-game)

- For the map screen, a tiny bit of 3D rotation makes visualizing elevation much easier (even if individual sections of the map are still 2D) => Should probably experiment with multiple map styles (with different levels of detail) => Inspired by watching Brian play Borderlands 3 (and seeing the map)

- Lock on system for combat (and lock onto NPCs to talk to them more easily, like Ocarina of Time) => Could try Joseph Anderson's idea of having a special enemy or boss that shakes your lock on and forces you to play differently

- Maybe some kind of musical instrument to play? (inspired by the fairy ocarina you get before the ocarina of time)

- Would be smart to have different attacks (and/or weapons) for different purposes (inspired by Elajjaz's Bloodborne first playthrough, when he used the extended axe's charged spin attack to take out a group of relatively week enemies in a spread in front) => Other attacks could have higher reach, longer range, or even hit enemies behind you

- Combat NPC who teaches you how to parry => Do you need to learn how to block first?

- When designing bosses, consider the boss's history and how that contributes to the boss's emotions during the fight (could help bosses feel more interesting and enjoyable)

- Should quest items (like keys) be sellable? Explicitly listing as a quest item is kind of a spoiler, since it reveales that the item is important and unique. Could give it a shitty sell price to discourage selling, or use brief character dialogue (or other context surrounding the item's acquisition) to clue into its importance. =>If the item *is* sellable, you'd need a way to retrieve it. Using this system, you could also add secrets (e.g. sell a special key and later learn that another NPC used it to traverse a dungeon early, or have a merchant comment that they observed the key and would be willing to pay a high price for it) => This could be a potentially promising system that would be pretty unique among games in the genre

- Puzzle mechanic involving manipulating frogs to eat insects or pull switches (inspired by re-reading an earlier idea about using torches to light up an area, but more creative than plain torches)

- Forest NPC who uses the essence of nature to trigger a radial effect that changes colors and causes flowers to blossom and sparkle (similar to an older idea, but could make for a really cool moment in the trailer)

- Ladder on a rotating platform (I just think this would look neat) => Maybe in the jester's house?

- "Living lava" enemies that form in a lava-filled area (likely deep underground somewhere, beneath the caves, imbued by a powerful sorcerer with essence of mind) => Could provide a cool opportunity for the player to use other essences for traversal or combat (i.e. you can't fight them normally since they'd just burn you, so you need to utilize special late-game equipment or spells)

- Factory-like section with some kind of train or minecarts running through on a regular basis (inspired by a CTR remake track from GDQx with a train going down the middle of the track the entire time as an interesting obstacle/cycle to avoid)

- For breakable objects (like boxes and barrels), consider what's inside them as well (rather than just an empty breakable wooden object)

- Make sure objects between the camera and the player are dithered or otherwise made mostly transparent in order to not unfairly disrupt gameplay (for example, shattering a destructible crate and having debris fly in front of the camera)

- Environmental objects that affect movement in fun ways (that can also make a zone more memorable and unique) => Inspired by watching Shogo: Mobile Armor Division during GDQx and seeing the player jump off air vents on the tops of buildings for extra height)

- For enemy health bars, could change the border color to grey to unambiguously communicate that the enemy is dead (to avoid the 1 HP sliver of health enemies can have in Dark Souls, where you think it's already dead)

- Quick catching your breath animation after running and jumping around for a while (like a one-time replacement idle animation following a bunch of movement)

- Large beast-like enemy that leaps in front to cut you off if you try to sprint away during the boss fight (inspired by watching Ela's casual playthrough of Aava in the third DS2 DLC)

- At night, consider fading distant objects to near full-black (inspired when driving home from Mary Poppins and seeing the dark silouette of trees)

- Could experiment with creating a fast-travel system comparable to Ori's save system (where players can make decisions about useful warp points) => Could also use a simpler system where you get a baseline number of warp points, but can place or unlock additional ones as a reward for some kind of gameplay => Inspired by Patty mentioning a lack of fast travel in Blasphemous

- Might be better to unlock faster and faster tiers of fast-travel throughout the game (to encourage players to learn the world and master movement (but unlock better systems when that traversal might start to become dull)

- For wall jump, should probably think about *how* the player is now able to WJ (inspired by watching Patty play Blasphemous and seeing the player stab the sword into walls to repeatedly gain height)

- Stone creatures that can't be effectively damaged with traditional sword swings (since they're made of stone) and instead require strong elemental damage (like lava infusion) or another powerful physics force to crack the stones apart (this concept could be applied to other enemy types as well to give more combat variety, like living lava creatures through which your sword harmlessly flows) => Inspired by Joseph Anderson's second DS2 video saying that hitting stone enemies never feels satisfying

- Consider how much content is gated behind potentially difficult bosses (so you don't screw struggling players too badly)

- Probably just re-watch "What Games Are Like For Someone Who Doesn't Play Games" several times (many good ideas in there)

- For larger boss health bars, consider visually moving the bar from center to bottom (to make sure newer players notice)

- Make sure that swimming has a variety of movement options just like platforming movement (along with Metroidvania upgrades and skills) => Inspired by Matthewmatosis's video on Mario 64, when he mentions that Mario's moveset underwater is much more limited than on the ground

- Consider some kind of last stand mechanic that allows survival after a fatal blow (inspired by one of Ela's Code Vein videos, where I mistakenly thought the stamina bar was health, so it looked like health ran out and you could keep going to save yourself) => Could be an upgrade?

- Should have some more vertically-oriented forms of fast travel as well (like a ski lift car that helps reach a village in the mountains, or an elevator to an underwater dungeon)

- Upgrade that lets you ascend up waterfalls (thin or taller, as another pseudo-form of vertical fast travel)

- "Keyshroom" item in the forest (key item that unlocks a special door)

- Try to weave character development and combat together (inspired by Razbuten's video on Mass Effect vs. Darkest Dungeon, and how in Mass Effect, narrative sections and combat encounters don't really react to one another in impactful ways) => Might be simpler and more effective for this genre to focus more on aligning character and player motivations (e.g. that dungeon looks cool and I'm curious to explore it, and it's *also* what the player character wants to do narratively)
