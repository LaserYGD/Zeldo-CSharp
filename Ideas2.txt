- If energy is infinite, what effect does that have on the economy?

- What if the races are attuned? (like the underground race being innately attuned to the essence of light)

- If a powerful essence of water could flood a town, that's a huge risk, but if the characters in the world didn't behave as such, that would be pretty immersion-breaking

- This stuff alleviates NPC fatigue by making you actually curious about who you're talking to

- Anything with permanence in the world is super important

- The game is non-linear (and characters should react appropriately), but make sure those reactions aren't too shallow

- In Oblivion/Skyrim, you can ask NPCs for rumors (which might spawn side quests). In Essence, characters could largely keep to themselves (within their town/zone), but YOU could provide those rumors (since you're the adventurer), and have that information propagate and even spur action by the villagers => Should probably use a hybrid system here

- If you go back and talk to an NPC who told you something, the dialogue should update to reflect what you've done/seen/learned since then

- Should the player character in Essence be a silent protagonist?

- I want the changes in the world to be based on choices the player makes through GAMEPLAY, not dialogue choices => Could still have NPCs react to the player implicitly (reacting to something you said, even though you never said it)

- What's the targeted overall length for a playthrough? How much (in terms of percentage) is a "normal" playthrough vs. 100% completion and late-game secrets? => I want a hidden late-game dungeon

- For the first game, what if we focused on only ONE essence? Would probably help massively in reducing the scope of the game, but would also set up a great foundation for future games or DLC => Would have to reduce the scope of the world as a result (and the number of races you meet)

- If you see one or two other races (even if they don't play a major role in the game), it would (hopefully) pique player curiosity about those races (which puts you in a great spot for future content)

- Could focus on one particular race's discovery of magic (but not necessarily the first race to EVER discover magic)

- Skippy said that a strength of his is "troubleshooting", like big-picture concerns (such as the nature of the world's economy if infinite-energy objects exist, and how valuable those would be) => Obi probably is too (but also excels at the details of that stuff)

- Could consider "tiers" of NPCs (main characters, secondary characters, and unnamed NPCs that largely don't speak or just provide flavor text) => Could help reduce NPC fatigue by reducing the number of characters to revisit

- What does the map screen look like? => I want to encourage the player to explore and focus on the world (rather than a screen)

- Can the player rotate the camera? If so, should the camera snap to four directions  Skippy mentioned he can't think of a single game with this style that can do that => With 3D, you kinda get this for free (and it'd be easy to experiment)

- With snapping, players might forget they can rotate the camera, which could cause frustrating if secrets are hidden behind an object (especially since camera rotation isn't common in the genre)

- Should the game just be a full 3D adventure?

- Secret "X marks the spot", an X formed by the environment that's visible from an elevated location (could lead to treasure or an optional upgrade)

- City with a river passing through it (few bridges across) => If the river is large, could be like sister cities across the river, with some level of rivalry between them

- Enemies who throw things at you (ranged attack), but they can be reflected back (maybe aimed, maybe automatically hit back?)

- In some dungeon, you can hear a curious, slightly unsettling noise for a while (to various degrees as you explore the dungeon), with the source (likely a boss) only revealed late (inspired by watching early footage of The Surge 2) => Might be too dark and creepy for what I'm going for with the game?

- Super, incredibly, unreasonably long ladder with epic music playing to emphasize how silly it is (maybe with a wisp-like companion character who comments while you're climbing) => Could play into the Ascend skill to really showcase how much more fluidly and quickly the character can move around

- Area/city built for large creatures (some kind of giants) as a way to experiment with the player's movement options in large spaces (inspired by watching Joseph Anderson's video on Dark Souls and seeing the character run through these huge, flat areas with nothing to block you)

- Make sure to include little things to reward the player's observation (inspired by a Dark Souls clip of shooting down a body hanging by a rope using a bow for a hidden item)

- Consider pacing in the overall design of the game (inspired by Mark Brown's Boss Keys episode on Dark Souls, where he splits the game into five acts and mentions that 1, 3, and 5 are relatively short and linear, while 2 and 4 are longer and more complex and branching)

- For fast travel, try to brainstorm ways to not ruin the player's sense of exploration and presence in the world (since, with something like a teleport, you don't need to think critically and understand how the world fits together)

- Think about ways to give the player options in exploring the world while still maintaining an interesting challenge (likely by making each zone *different* rather than simply scaling difficulty, i.e. try to test different player skills)

- If you showcase a cool area, make sure the player is able to actually go there (or at least interact in some interesting way) => Inspired by Joseph Anderson's video on The Ringed City where he said he was disappointed he couldn't explore this huge city the game drew attention to

- Sliding challenge section (inspired by watching a slide in that 3D Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban game) => Probably not an actual slide, but maybe a hilly section that accommodates multiple slides well

- Late-game puzzle inspired by that idea I had for the GMTK jam 2019: each version of the game has slightly different aspects in some key ways, and players need to work together as a community to solve the final puzzle (maybe contextualized as alternate realities?) => Probably not worth it, but who knows

- Elevator system from the cave village to a surface city (maybe the capitol?) that's only built following certain world events that improve relations among the two cities (or maybe you discover them underground and then help to start forming a new relationship to stay more positive?) => Could take a bit of in-game time, advancing when you exit and reload? Might be too slow for speedrunning considerations

- Spiral plant, like little springs (inspired by a picture on Reddit of a spiral pepper)

- Smooth transitions as the game starts up => Load a scene from the most recent save file, and start playing soft music and ambient noises during the splash screen and into the title, then, when the player selects Continue, briefly pan the camera down to the player's location (if another file is chosen, you can do a proper load with a quick screen transition through black)

- Hydra-like boss that you slowly defeat over the course of probably three encounters (chipping away at it each time) => Lots of games do this already though, in the sense of a repeated boss fight (e.g. Klungo from Banjo Tooie)

- Make sure enemies are varied (in terms of playstyle, but also visually so you don't just have a bunch of humanoids)

- Minor tech to quickly increase downward movement (inspired by Dead Cell's quick downward stomp mechanic, but also Ori's stomp. Could get boring to just walk off a ledge and wait to fall without any means to better control your movement) => If it's a stomp, the transition from hitting the ground to regular movement needs to be smooth (maybe a button press just after the stomp that gives a quick boost in some direction?) => Feels un-smooth to have a stomp kill your horizontal momentum most of the time

- Make sure the player can level up outside of the game as well as powering up in game (inspired by Joseph Anderson's video on Dragon's Dogma) => In other words, skills need depth and precision (including how they're chained together) so that, with practice, players can get better and faster and more efficient with damage

- How are mistakes punished in various areas? (primarly platforming mistakes and combat mistakes, but also maybe inventory mistakes, like selling an important piece of gear) => Needs to be balanced properly to make the game challenging, but not ultra hard

- Make sure that players, in addition to locations they're guided to by the main quest, can explore and discover cool places for themselves (and actually progress without too many locked doors punishing their curiosity) => Also inspired by Dragon's Dogma (where Joseph Anderson said he found cool places, but the front door was always locked until he reached the appropriate quest)

- For AOE attacks (like boss explosions after a charge time), should display a dim circle (or sphere) that subtly shows its range

- Parry mechanic (in some form, and ideally different skills can parry/reflect different kinds of attacks in different ways, such as knocking a thrusting, fast enemy off center, making them vulnerable to attack)

- After watching Spike struggle with the Broken Vessel in Hollow Knight for a while, I hate contact damage with enemies and almost certainly won't implement it in Essence (with the exception of, for example, an enemy clearly covered in spikes or spewing toxic gas or something) => Could also experiment with reversing the system and damaging enemies when they touch you, IF you're wearing appropriate gear

- Being stunned in place temporarily following a long fall never feels good (since it interrupts the flow of movement and might expose you to damage) => Inspired by HK, but Odyssey does the same thing

- If there's a dash, dashing into a wall should allow an immediate, smooth wall jump (likely with a small amount of input buffering) => Inspired by watching Spike play the forced aerial section of the HK arena and dashing into nearby walls, but still stuck in the dash animation and unable to cleanly and quickly gain wall control

- Probably better to focus on interesting, memorable boss fights rather than strictly long or difficult ones (although the various gimmicks should still generally introduce fun, engaging new challenges as well) => Inspired by watching Eiko face an early boss in Astral Chain, and I was intrigued at what looked like free exploration and tracking down a boss before starting a fight in an open environment

- Should have the effects of defeating bosses be noticeable and worthwhile in some way

- Hidden passage from the throne room to another area (or maybe from a dungeon cell?)

- Hidden area in the ground, signalled by a hollow sound when you walk across it (inspired by the hidden White Defender boss in HK, accessed by ground pounding an unmarked section of floor) => Could arguably use subtle environmental arrangements to point to a special location

- Puzzles involving water manipulation (like using an essence to create an aerial arc of water to swim over a gap) => Could experiment with currents as well

- Octopus boss as the first (or very early) part of the dungeon, as the "keeper" of the water essence (he uses it against you in various ways, which has a side effect of teaching you some of the essence's uses) => That idea of every essence having a "Keeper" seems like a great idea

- Could experiment with wind directions in the windmill dungeon as a puzzle mechanism (like aligning gears or directions) => Skippy's idea, inspired by BotW's Divine Beasts, where pressing buttons or flipping switches affects the entire dungeon at a large scale

- For the windmill, the entire, giant structure could slowly rotate in response to dynamic wind (hear a creak as the structure starts to move, see shafts of sunlight change, look out the window and see yourself rotating), but still maintain the level design (since everything inside the dungeon remained relatively fixed)

- Boss with an attack that throws you into the air and knocks you away, but allows you to recover and control yourself using regular movement mechanics (inspired by watching Spike face Champion Gundyr, who has an attack that launches you into the air, followed by a quick shoulder charge) => The boss could even jump after you to add a lot more dynamic movement to the fight

- Boss using reflected sunlight via shafts in the ceiling (maybe you have to trigger the boss to break them during the fight?) => Could also add a few breakable spots throughout the dungeon to optionally make the fight easier

- Trees with distinct shapes and different-colored leaves in different zones (inspired by a cool picture on Reddit of a tree changing colors from green to bright orange, but since Essence doesn't have seasons, the colors have to be applied to different trees more permanently)

- Followup idea: using an essence (the essence of nature, maybe?) to affect plans (trees, grass, flowers, foliage, etc.) near the player (almost like a soft radial explosion that causes plants to move, change color, grow fruit, etc.) => This brings up an interesting thought, which is including elements in a trailer (like this visual flair explosion) without necessarily spoiling exactly WHAT the thing is or HOW it's used. As a rule of thumb, that could be a very effective way to build an intriguing trailer without spoiling the cool parts too much
