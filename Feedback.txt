- Neutral deceleration in the air is too fast
- Deceleration on the ground is okay, but takes getting used to because it's so fast
- Field of view is fish-eyed
- Sometimes the player is pinballed away near seams while grounded
- Player can fall through the world when jumping near steps in a particular way
- Player can clip through the ground when pressing into a sloped, overhanging ceiling (and jumping)
- Bounciness when pressing into walls (sometimes pretty severe)
- Some strange shadowing artifacts when moving the camera in certain ways
- Some strange triangle artifacts (in the same vein)
- Running along sloped ground triangles feels odd (might be because of FOV)
- Difficult to wall jump off of thin platforms
- Slow downward clipping into the rope bridge
- Velocity doesn't seem to fully stop on ground triangles (possible to fall off even with neutral input while supposedly stopped)
- When on a wall with velocity along that wall, feels odd that a neutral wall jump launches you perpendicular to the wall (should use a reflected angle instead)
