- Note system for the map (could be contextualized as the player character literally writing notes on a physical map), with optional player text (or maybe sketches?)

- The beginning of Force Unleashed has really solid writing and character development (worth watching multiple times as inspiration for effective character introductions) => Likely worth going back and playing older PS2 games as well (in order to remember how fun games can actually be)

- Weapon infusions from attacking through substances (inspired by watching Force Unleashed in an area with toxic sludge, which led to the idea of slashing through a material to temporarily infuse your weapon) => Could also apply to projectiles (like arrows), and should maybe be a magical upgrade instead

- Neutral NPCs for additional variety (inspired by Jawas in Force Unleashed)

- If enemies can be jumped on, could experiment with up-slashing an enemy into the air, then gaining a bit of extra height (via DJ or an extra aerial lift), then bouncing from there (potential speed tech)

- Special crystals/gems as collectibles with gameplay effects (maybe a different kind of item, since crystals are a bit cliched when magic is involved?)
