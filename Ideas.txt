- Small fire that needs to be grown bigger and bigger by providing various sources of fuel (some that decay and some that don't) in order to trigger a secret (inspired by Chilled TTT part 139 near the beginning)

- Visible watch that appears as an overlay while a button is held (tells you the time of day more accurately than just watching the sun, which is especially useful underground) => Could use a custom time/date system that players can learn in-game (ideally through an optional, but easy-to-find side quest relatively early in the game) => Clockmaker NPC who can upgrade the watch to also view weather patterns and lunar phases

- Room with clutter arranged in such a way that it forms a subtle arrow pointing at a secret wall (could do the same with shadows in an indoor space with clever lighting)

- While it's raining, have leaves on trees occasionally twitch (to simulate a raindrop landing) => Could even use RNG based on the orientation of the leaf (such that flatter leaves react to raindrops more frequently)
