- Small fire that needs to be grown bigger and bigger by providing various sources of fuel (some that decay and some that don't) in order to trigger a secret (inspired by Chilled TTT part 139 near the beginning)

- Visible watch that appears as an overlay while a button is held (tells you the time of day more accurately than just watching the sun, which is especially useful underground) => Could use a custom time/date system that players can learn in-game (ideally through an optional, but easy-to-find side quest relatively early in the game) => Clockmaker NPC who can upgrade the watch to also view weather patterns and lunar phases

- Room with clutter arranged in such a way that it forms a subtle arrow pointing at a secret wall (could do the same with shadows in an indoor space with clever lighting)

- While it's raining, have leaves on trees occasionally twitch (to simulate a raindrop landing) => Could even use RNG based on the orientation of the leaf (such that flatter leaves react to raindrops more frequently)

- The ability to increase your strength a few times (maybe with items or maybe as an inherent character trait). Some weapons might require 1-2 strength upgrades to wield effectively (like heavy hammers). Can also use to solve puzzles and bypass obstacles (similar to LTTP), but could also have other more hidden changes (such as the ability to turn a wheel that previously was too heavy to move) => Like Matthewmatosis said about Zelda, make sure strength upgrades are consistent in terms of effects

- 3D map (with a similar fixed angle/perspective/pixelated rendering style to the main game). Camera should be able to pan around and zoom too (to an extent). Maybe rotate a bit too, but only very slightly? => Inspired by watching a Metroid TAS with Jared and seeing the station map start to reveal itself when examining a terminal => Could also display correct lighting/shadows and be upgraded to show realistic weather patterns as well (maybe even with synced timing on lightning and such)
