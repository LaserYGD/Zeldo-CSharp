- Small fire that needs to be grown bigger and bigger by providing various sources of fuel (some that decay and some that don't) in order to trigger a secret (inspired by Chilled TTT part 139 near the beginning)

- Visible watch that appears as an overlay while a button is held (tells you the time of day more accurately than just watching the sun, which is especially useful underground) => Could use a custom time/date system that players can learn in-game (ideally through an optional, but easy-to-find side quest relatively early in the game) => Clockmaker NPC who can upgrade the watch to also view weather patterns and lunar phases

- Room with clutter arranged in such a way that it forms a subtle arrow pointing at a secret wall (could do the same with shadows in an indoor space with clever lighting)

- While it's raining, have leaves on trees occasionally twitch (to simulate a raindrop landing) => Could even use RNG based on the orientation of the leaf (such that flatter leaves react to raindrops more frequently)

- The ability to increase your strength a few times (maybe with items or maybe as an inherent character trait). Some weapons might require 1-2 strength upgrades to wield effectively (like heavy hammers). Can also use to solve puzzles and bypass obstacles (similar to LTTP), but could also have other more hidden changes (such as the ability to turn a wheel that previously was too heavy to move) => Like Matthewmatosis said about Zelda, make sure strength upgrades are consistent in terms of effects

- 3D map (with a similar fixed angle/perspective/pixelated rendering style to the main game). Camera should be able to pan around and zoom too (to an extent). Maybe rotate a bit too, but only very slightly? => Inspired by watching a Metroid TAS with Jared and seeing the station map start to reveal itself when examining a terminal => Could also display correct lighting/shadows and be upgraded to show realistic weather patterns as well (maybe even with synced timing on lightning and such)

- Speech system using sound effects (similar to Banjo Kazooie, but less silly), with pitch/inflection that can subtly bend up or down based on simple text rules (such as pitching upward at the end of a sentence if that line of text ends with a question mark). Could go a long way towards helping characters feel more memorable and expressive (could experiment with modifying/animating parts of the text to mimic this inflection, such as text shaking to indicate fear)

- Make sure many areas have multiple ways to move around (to make replayability and experimentation more important, and to aid with the depth of speedrun routing) => Be especially careful of this problem for tall stages (which might be tedious to climb several times) => The Ascend skill will probably help with this a lot, though

- Consider zooming in the camera a bit when the player goes into a smaller building (inspired by Game Maker's Toolkit mentioning that BotW does this trick)

- Dungeon with the main entrance close/collapsed, so you need to enter through a secret side entrance (could also use this as a way to access visible, but inaccessible secrets within a dungeon) => Probably shouldn't have the door be locked because that implies you can find a key

- Percentage display on a save slot that's hidden by default and needs to be explicitly shown by the player (in order to not reveal how much of the game is left)

- Consider how the health and mana systems affect gameplay (inspired by Mark Brown's video on health, where he mentions that when you're running low on health in Doom, the game is designed to encourage aggressive behavior) => Consider a Halo-style system with a regenerating shield (can be contextualized in-game), but non-regenerating health (might be too complex?) => Also consider rewarding aggressive play vs. passive play at different skill levels

- Consider doing something more creative with death

- Remember the giraffe section from The Last of Us (peaceful moments where the player can just relax and enjoy the view)

- Make sure the map is "calling out to be explored" (phrasing used by Mark Brown in his written thoughts on Rage 2) => Given the viewpoint, this can still be done with visuals, but should also be bolstered by narrative and character reasons to explore a new area

- Make sure upgrades are sufficiently impactful to be worth the trouble to find them (i.e. don't give shitty 5% stat boosts. Make them bigger, like double damage or a new elemental effect that alters gameplay in an interesting way)

- Make sure there are interesting reasons to use different weapons and abilities (inspired by Mark Brown's written review of Rage 2, where he said there's never any reason to use anything other than the basic assault rifle) => Specific enemy weaknesses can achieve this, or maybe altering loot dropped based on kill style (letting you tailor your combat style to whether you need health, mana, money, or other resources)

- Consider enemy prioritization during combat (this would be helped by enemies who primarily buff others or affect the environment in some way) => Would also be good if there isn't always a clear answer on what the "correct" or "best" combat choice is for a particular encounter, especially for speedrunning

- Difficulty curve can be tricky in open-world games (e.g. Dark Souls after you get the Lordvessel) => Could experiment with powering up enemies as you complete dungeons, or something that better fits the narrative, like the villain beginning to concentrate forces to the remaining strongholds

- Should also be careful to not always make the game harder and harder. It can be nice to really enjoy the new power you've received by just wrecking relatively easy enemies and bosses in the mid- to late-game, rather than always having to struggle

- "The Old Kingdom", a large, secret, late-game zone hidden deep under the world (inspired by Mark Brown's video on Dark Souls and the feeling of going deeper and deeper, or ascending higher and higher) => The kingdom should be discussed and have lore hidden in books to add an air of mystery that this place might actually exist

- A hidden underground collection of bridges and passageways acting as "fast travel" for the world (rather than giving a teleport and potentially breaking the player's need for exploration and memorable landmarks) => Could have at least one character discuss teleportation as something magic hasn't achieved yet, or maybe even have teleportation be unlocked in the late-game to facilitate 100% completion (once the player is likely to have already explored to an acceptable level)

- Could also have limited fast-travel points to major hubs in the world, but only a handful of them (could be contextualized in-game by requiring some kind of structure as a teleport location)

- Enemies/bosses that interact (inspired by watching Dunkey's video on Monster Hunter World when a giant bird swoops in and picks up the t-rex being fought) => Could also have rare roaming enemies that only appear under specific circumstances (like a hidden boss)

- An item to retrieve and return (like an egg that can eventually be hatched)

- Sleeping mobs (or even sleeping bosses, like a dungeon it's possible to sneak through until the very end if entered at night)

- Electricity beast (something that can channel lightning to an extent, or becomes way more powerful during a thunderstorm, but also drops an upgraded version of its loot)

- Dungeon based on darkness, light, and shadows (inspired by watching one of Chilled's TTT videos where the lights go off and everyone has a flashlight)

- Quick idea: caves with shafts of light at the start (plus some ambient light), but it gets progressively darker and more difficult as you descend (which also requires using light items)

- Hidden, cryptic map that can lead to an endgame secret (inspired by the Vitruvian Grub in Hollow Knight)

- Train system (or maybe increasingly more forms of fast travel at various speeds and among various locations, triggered by completing world events)

- In many video game dungeons, there's stress associated with picking the "correct" path forward vs. exploring side rooms (since you don't want to miss stuff). Could be cool to subtly signal which is the correct path through lighting effects (based on theme), such as a shaft of light or bright torch outside certain doors or tunnels => Might be detrimental to exploration. The goal is to have players run around and explore without stressing about whether they took the "wrong" path

- Something like prism stones could help here too (and allow more complex, labyrith-like areas to be built)

- Be imaginitive with upgrades and items => Make sure that obstacles make sense to exist in the world, rather than simply being place artificially to block the player (inspired by Matthewmatosis's video on Axiom Verge and Environmental Station Alpha)

- Large creatures/machinery slowing moving in the background (inspired by a Trials Fusion track with a big robot slowing doing its work in the background)

- Cash-gobbling enemy (saps up coins or other loot, but drops all of it when killed) => Should be rare, or maybe even an NPC

- Consider how the player character's actions and decision-making align with the player (inspired by Matthewmatosis's video on Demon Souls, where he mentioned that being creative in fights and traversing slowly and cautiously are how an actual person would behave in that situation, not exploiting known AI patterns to dodge attacks) => Outsmart the bosses, not just press roll at the right time

- Try to make encounters (bosses, enemies, dungeons, characters, movement, etc.) varied and exciting so the player doesn't get bored and is encouraged to flex different gaming skillsets

- Should take care to build up the shipwreck as an actual object that existed (maybe by finding part of it wrecked on a beach, meeting a rare survivor, or viewing and learning about an in-progress rebuild of a new ship) => Consider which characters would logically know about the ship and how they could help the player locate and traverse its wreckage at the bottom of the lake

- Flame weapon upgrade (or elemental upgrades in general) to absorb nearby sources of that essence and use it to power up your attacks (inspired by my potential Kitterket enemy, which I imagine as a cat-like creature that pounces away and leaves a trail of fire or toxin) => Could be interesting because it would recontextualize a hazardous damage source as a tool to incorporate into combat

- Music should gradually grow and evolve over the course of a dungeon (not only gaining energy, but also carefully losing energy and presence in rare cases) => Could be triggered by reaching a certain level of progression in the dungeon, similar to (I think) what Ori does

- In dungeons, consider how individual rooms play into the flow of the entire dungeon (rather than just being isolated challenges unrelated to one another) => What's the over-arching objective of the dungeon? How does each isolated section help you progress towards it?
